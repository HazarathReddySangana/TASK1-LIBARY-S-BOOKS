# TASK1-LIBARY-S-BOOKS
Designing a library database involves creating tables for books, members, and transactions, followed by performing operations like inserting, updating, deleting, and retrieving data. Below is a step-by-step guide to building this project:

Step 1: Define Database Schema

1. Books Table:

Stores information about books in the library.

Fields: book_id (Primary Key), title, author, isbn, published_year, status (to track availability).

2. Members Table:

Stores information about members who can borrow books.

Fields: member_id (Primary Key), first_name, last_name, email, phone, join_date.

3. Transactions Table:

Records borrow and return transactions for books.

Fields: transaction_id (Primary Key), book_id (Foreign Key), member_id (Foreign Key), borrow_date, return_date.

STEP 2 :CREATE AN BOOKS TABLE AND INSERT DATA IN THE THAT TABLE
         "KEYS USED INTHE TABLE AND INSERT DATA"
      1. CREATE 
      2. DECLARE FIELD WHAT ARE USED IN THE DATABASE SCHEME.
      3. INSERT THE DAT BY INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME.
      4. AFTER INSERT THE DATA CHECK WHARE THE TABLE FROMED OR NOT.

STEP3 :CREATE AN MEMBERS TABLE AND INSERT DATA IN THE THAT TABLE
         "KEYS USED INTHE TABLE AND INSERT DATA"
      1. CREATE 
      2. DECLARE FIELD WHAT ARE USED IN THE DATABASE SCHEME.
      3. INSERT THE DAT BY INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME.

STEP 4 :- CREATE AN TRANSACTIONS TABLE AND INSERT DATA IN THE THAT TABLE
         "KEYS USED INTHE TABLE AND INSERT DATA"
      1. CREATE 
      2. DECLARE FIELD WHAT ARE USED IN THE DATABASE SCHEME.
      3. INSERT THE DAT BY INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME.
      4. AFTER INSERT THE DATA CHECK WHARE THE TABLE FROMED OR NOT.
